Concepts  and Use cases 
 - What problems does SNAP solve?
	 - SNAP is a product intended for slice and dice analysis /OLAP style analysis on very large datasets.
	 - It can be used as a replacement for traditional OLAP cubes to overcome issues with scale and performance
	 - SNAP can be an alternative to tools like Hive, Impala as well as Analytic databases like Greenplum, Vertica , Redshift etc.
	 - SNAP can be used as an alternative to building extracts ( Tableau extracts, or custom extracts of data for performance)
	 - SNAP can be used when you want fast query performance without Aggregating the data
	 -
 - What is not intended for?
	 - SNAP is not a database and is not intended for transactions
	 - SNAP is not meant to be used for ETL workloads or Batch reporting
 - Who uses SNAP?
	 - SNAP is used by Fortune 10 companies with extensive datawarehousing needs and multi-table joins as well as by high velocity data use cases such as in Ad-Tech.

Key concepts 
 - Qube 
	 - A Qube is a logical abstraction in SNAP
	 - It consists of 
		 - A join graph represented by means of the Star Schema definition of the datasets involved in the Qube( Facts and Dimensions)
		 - OLAP Index 
			 - A logical model of dimensions and metrics ( columns from the tables in the star schema) 
 - What is an OLAP Index?
	 - Logical Definition
		 - An OLAP index defines the columns, organized as dimensions and metrics, in the Qube
	 - Physical representation
		 - An OLAP index is physically stored as columnar compressed data of the columns in the Qube and indexes on the dimensions of the Qube
 - Why is it fast?
	 - SNAP is fast because
		 - It comes with several optimizations for traditional datawarehousing use cases( SQL optimizations) 
		 - It uses an in-memory index and cache mechanism for fast queries
 - What does it take to deploy ?
	 - SNAP is built on Apache Spark. Its different than many products that “Integrate” with Spark. SNAP is embedded within Spark and hence SNAP deployment is Spark Deployment
	 - Start a Spark cluster with the SNAP jars and deploy standalone or on YARN
 - How is SNAP different from Spark ?
	 - SNAP is different from Spark even though it shares the run time of Spark.
		 - SNAP uses the concept of in-memory indexes and its own file format and optimizations. When running SNAP all queries submitted to SNAP through the SNAP server is managed and optimized by the SNAP engine.
		 - SNAP is accessed through the SNAP server which is a thin layer on the Spark Thrift server. So any B.I tool that can connect to Spark Thriftserver can connect to SNAP
